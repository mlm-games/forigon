## vv1.1.2

- Rename build step for clarity in release workflow
- Update versionName to v1.1.0
- Add screenshots and icons
- Add dragging of icons in bubble layout (very laggy in the start for larger app count, but understandable)
- descs. update
- Add an UI indicator for the virtual bezel actions
- Add gestures support for swipe up and down actions on home screen
- works well, but scrolls need to be improved
